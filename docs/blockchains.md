# Supported Blockchains
Our aim is to provide our users with a safe place to stake their funds on **as many blockchains as possible**, as long as they are compatible with Ethereum smart contracts and have significant DeFi activity. DeFi is a dynamic place, however, so we cannot catch 'em all! 

These are the blockchains we plan to support and their current feature status
