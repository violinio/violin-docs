# Violin by RugDoc
Brought to you by RugDoc, **Violin Finance** is your trusted **single entry point** to invest your hard-earned funds into DeFi projects. Just as for our parent organization, our primary focus is the security of our users â€” therefore we carefully review every listed project to make sure it conforms to our standards (this goes doubly for sponsored projects). 

To bring security to you everywhere, we aim to support as many blockchains as possible (as long as they are compatible with Ethereum smart contracts). But DeFi is a dynamic space, so see [Blockchains](blockchains.md) to learn which features we support on your favourite blockchain.

# Contracts
Before approving any deposit of funds on our website, we recommend to double-check that you are interacting with our official [Contracts](contracts.md).
