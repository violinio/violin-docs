# Violin by RugDoc
Brought to you by RugDoc, Violin Finance is your trusted single entry point to invest your hard-earned funds into DeFi projects. As for our parent organization, our primary focus is the security of our users â€” therefore we carefully review every listed project to make sure it conforms to our standards (this goes doubly for sponsored projects). 

To bring security to you everywhere, we aim to support as many blockchains as possible (as long as they are compatible with Ethereum smart contracts). But DeFi is a dynamic space, so please see [Blockchains](blockchains.md) to see which features we support on your favourite blockchain.

# Features and Roadmap

Our Token Locker allows users (typically DeFi projects) to deposit tokens into a specialized contract that only allows them to be withdrawn after a certain amount of time. For more details, please visit [Locker](locker.md)
