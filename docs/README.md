# Violin by RugDoc
Brought to you by RugDoc, **Violin Finance** is your trusted **single entry point** to invest your hard-earned funds into DeFi projects. Just as for our parent organization, our primary focus is the security of our users — therefore we carefully review every listed project to make sure it conforms to our standards (this goes doubly for sponsored projects). 

To bring security to you everywhere, we aim to support as many blockchains as possible (as long as they are compatible with Ethereum smart contracts). But DeFi is a dynamic space, so see [Blockchains](blockchains.md) to learn which features we support on your favourite blockchain.

# Features and Roadmap
## Token Locker
Our Token Locker allows users (typically DeFi projects) to deposit tokens into a specialized contract which only allows them to be withdrawn after a certain amount of time. For more details, visit [Locker](locker.md).

## Vaults (soon)
Vaults are Violin's main feature. They allow you to stake funds into other DeFi smart contracts via our user interface. They automatically harvest and compound your tokens, so they are a great way to save on both time and transaction costs! 

## Zaps (planned)
Zaps are a convenience feature that lets you deposit any token into a Vault — all the swapping and liquidity pooling is done behind the scenes by our Zap contract.

# Contracts
Before approving any deposit of funds on our website, we recommend to double-check that you are interacting with our official [Contracts](contracts.md).
