# Token Locker

## Soft rugs
One of the most common ways shady DeFi projects scam users is with so-called **soft rugs**. A soft rug refers to a project's dev team trashing the price of the native token in some way to abscond with the money. There are two typical ways for this to be executed: **first**, projects may simply *mint a large number of native tokens* and sell them; **second**, projects may initially set up a large liquidity pool (e.g. native/USDC) to attract funds, but then *redeem the pool shares* and sell all of their native tokens.

## Lockers to the rescue
To guarantee users are safe from the second type of scam, many projects deposit their LP tokens into a special type of smart contract called a "Locker". This contract will ensure that the project team **is unable to redeem their liquidity pool shares** until the lockup period has ended. Liquidity locking is an important part of protecting DeFi users and generally viewed as a signal of the devs' long-term commitment. 

## Dev shares
Some projects may also choose to mint a certain number of tokens as a reward for their core team, but lock them for a certain amount of time to reassure users that they will not simply dump them as soon as the hype train starts and the price pumps.


## Our contribution
**As our gift to the community, we offer projects the ability to lock tokens in a secure smart contract for free**. RugDoc encourages all DeFi projects to lock their initial native token liquidity and Violin's locker feature is our way to make sure this is available to every project, no matter the size.

## Holding contracts
Our Locker **generates a separate contract for every chunk of locked funds** for maximum security. By interacting directly with the smart contract, projects may choose to save some gas by depositing tokens directly into the Locker contract, but in some rare cases (such as tokens whose supply decreases over time), this may lead to issues.
## Lock share NFT
After the tokens are locked in our contract, you will receive an ERC-721 NFT token to represent the locked funds. This NFT can be transferred to other wallets or sold if desired â€” a transfer of the token does not unlock funds, but **whoever holds the token is the only person who can withdraw the locked tokens once they are released**. 
## Optional Governance Unlock
When locking tokens, projects may choose to allow RugDoc to prematurely release their funds before the lockout period is over. **This can only be executed by RugDoc herself on request**, and such requests are only granted after a careful review of the  projects' individual circumstances (e.g. if they have to re-deploy due to a bug but already locked liquidity).

Governance can never withdraw tokens to their wallet, **the only account which can withdraw funds after they were unlocked is the [NFT](#lock-share-nft) holder**

For even more security, projects who are certain that they will not need the premature unlock may forgo this emergency net and lock without a governance override, or renounce the governance override later.
