# Contracts
There is a remote possibility that our frontend is hacked, or you might accidentally visit a fraudulent clone of our frontend, or a different project may create another frontend for our smart contracts and then swap them out for malicious contracts at a later date.

Therefore, it is important in DeFi to **always check which contract you are interacting with**. See the [RugDoc Wiki](https://wiki.rugdoc.io/docs/how-to-check-your-contract-interactions/) for a more detailed explanation and a guide.

# Official Violin contracts
Once we are live, we will list our official contracts for each blockchain here.
